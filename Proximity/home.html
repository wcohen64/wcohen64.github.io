					&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Proximity Hub is an inductive charging device that works in short distances with the use of an electromagnetic field to charge your smart device. Being sold through stations called Proximity Hubs, it’s a great accessory to any restaurants, cafes, and bars. Therefore, these are the main locations that the product is currently being sold in around the greater Rochester focusing around Strong Memorial Hospital and other hospitals.
					<br>
					&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Proximity Charge, being a relatively new company, uses a specific hardware to allow smart devices to charge wirelessly. Some companies that support the hardware required to use Proximity Charge are Apple, Samsung, Google, LG, Microsoft, Dell, ad Lenovo. The hardware comes with all new smart devices but can also be installed for free if taken back to the store. 
					<br>
					&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For the use of Proximity Hubs we also created 2 FREE mobile applications. The Proximity Connect App is used to connect to the hub and give the smart device access to charge. The Proximity Manager App is used to check on the status and usage of personal hubs or connects around the area. 
					<br>
					&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Some concerns may include the keeping up with repairs and maintenance or finding an optimal spot of the hub to stand on. These concerns are minor and easily resolved. Proximity Charge is looking to change the way charging happens around the world and to erase every doubt in the minds of customers.
